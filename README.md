# Hell Garage App - Car Service ERP System

Welcome to the Hell Garage App repository! This is a typical React app â€“ it's a simple yet powerful ERP system designed to help you manage your car service operations efficiently.

## My First React Project

As a newcomer to the realm of React, this project marks a significant milestone in my coding journey. What started as a curious exploration of components, state management, and UI design has culminated in the creation of the Hell Garage App. While the app itself helps car enthusiasts manage their garage operations, it also mirrors my progression from React beginner to a developer capable of crafting functional, user-friendly applications.

## Dependencies and npm Packages

The Hell Garage App was built with the help of various npm packages and libraries that enhanced its functionality and appearance. Here are some of the key packages we used in this project:

### Formik

[Formik](https://formik.org/) is a fantastic form library for React. It simplifies form handling and validation, making it easier to create complex forms with ease.

```bash
npm install formik
```

### Yup

[Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) is a schema validation library that pairs perfectly with Formik. It allows you to define and enforce validation rules for your form fields.

```bash
npm install yup
```

### Material-UI

[Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) is a popular React UI framework that provides a wide range of components and styles, following the Material Design guidelines.

```bash
npm install @mui/material @mui/icons-material
```

### Roboto Font

We used the Roboto font family from Google Fonts to enhance the typography of our app.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap" />
```

### React-Cookie

[React-Cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie) is used for managing cookies in our application, which is important for maintaining user sessions and security.
```bash
npm install react-cookie
```

### Other Dependencies
In addition to these key packages, we also used various other npm packages to enhance different aspects of the app. You can find the full list of dependencies in our <b>package.json</b> file.

## JWT Tokens for Security

For enhanced security, we employ JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in the Hell Garage App. JWT tokens are used for user authentication and authorization, ensuring that our app remains secure and user data is protected.

## Mock Data
Please note that the current version of the Hell Garage App is using mock data for demonstration purposes. While the app provides a realistic experience of managing car service operations, the data displayed is not connected to a live database.
